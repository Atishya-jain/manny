It allows us to visualize the results of the algorithms implemented.\r\n- We've started by implementing search algorithms to solve navigation problem in the Pac-Man world.\r\n- Up to now our agents can navigate using four different methods: Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and A* Search.\r\n- Basic comparison of the initial methods along with illustrations and visuals are available in the first draft.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# March 23, 2016\r\n\r\nIn this project we aim to implement a multi-agent system for playing Pac-Man, which is an arcade game first released in Japan in 1980. In Pac-Man, the player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots; while the enemies chase him to touch. When all pac-dots are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next stage. When an enemy touches Pac-Man, a life is lost. \r\n\r\nIn order to implement a multi-agent system for playing Pac-Man, we will apply a number of AI techniques: \r\n\r\n## 1. Search\r\nFirst, we will implement basic search and multi-agent search algorithms. Basic search algorithms will be used to solve navigation problem in Pac-Man. Multi-agent search algorithms will be used since Pac-Man is a multiplayer game modeled as both an adversarial and stochastic search problem. We will consider depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms for basic search; minimax, expectimax, alpha-beta pruning, reflex agents and heuristic based approaches for multi-agent search. \r\n\r\n## 2. Reinforcement Learning\r\n\r\nSecondly, we will implement reinforcement learning algorithms for playing Pac-Man using features extracted along with weights updated through training. We will consider simple machine learning algorithms like value iteration and Q learning. \r\n\r\n## Links and References\r\n1.
