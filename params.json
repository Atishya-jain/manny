  "body": "In this project we aim to implement a multi-agent system for playing Pac-Man, which is an arcade game first released in Japan in 1980. In Pac-Man, the player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots; while the enemies chase him to touch. When all pac-dots are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next stage. When an enemy touches Pac-Man, a life is lost. \r\n\r\nIn order to implement a multi-agent system for playing Pac-Man, we will apply a number of AI techniques: \r\n\r\n## 1. Search\r\nFirst, we will implement basic search and multi-agent search algorithms. Basic search algorithms will be used to solve navigation problem in Pac-Man. Multi-agent search algorithms will be used since Pac-Man is a multiplayer game modeled as both an adversarial and stochastic search problem. We will consider depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms for basic search; minimax, expectimax, alpha-beta pruning, reflex agents and heuristic based approaches for multi-agent search. \r\n\r\n## 2. Reinforcement Learning\r\n\r\nSecondly, we will implement reinforcement learning algorithms for playing Pac-Man using features extracted along with weights updated through training. We will consider simple machine learning algorithms like value iteration and Q learning. \r\n\r\n## Links and References\r\n1.
